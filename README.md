   Hi everyone, Zarina here!

ğŸ‘€ I am interested in blockchain. 
    In addition to that, I enjoy beeing active and outdoors. 
    Going out with the dogs, running, or just picking mushrooms in the forest. 
    Before my career change, I have been involved in equestrian sports and the equine industry. 
     
ğŸŒ± Currently Iâ€™m studying to become a blockchain developer at Medieinstitutet
            âœ¨ looking for an internship in autumn 2023 âœ¨
